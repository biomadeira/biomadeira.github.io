I have enjoyed every minute of the last two days where me and my friends participated in the [Biotechnology YES 2013 competition](http://www.biotechnologyyes.co.uk/biotechnologyyes/index.aspx) hosted in the Biocity venue in Glasgow. It was a great learning experience though very stressful as well. We literally didn't sleep finishing our business plan and presentation for the big day!
  
Unfortunately we didn't make it to the London finals, but I would say we still won a lot!
