Me and a bunch of other students and staff members of the University of Dundee organized the first ever [TEDx University of Dundee](http://tedxuod.co.uk/). Together with my buddy Thiago, my main task was to design and develop the event's website and organize ticket sale.

The event was a great success and featured several prominent speakers in their fields from the Dundee area. Big thanks to everyone involved!
