After many months of hard work, the day is here! Our new paper on methods to predict 14-3-3-binding sites is out in Bioinformatics Journal. This project originated as a collaboration between the Barton Group and the MacKintosh Group on the quest for improving the quality of predictions on 14-3-3-binding sites.

This work was really exciting because put together nice science with nice technology. I really enjoyed learning a lot more about artificial neural networks and support vector machines. In addition to this, I had the chance to developed a webpage server enabling other researchers to use the new methods in a convenient way. The webserver was mainly developed in Python with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is available at [compbio.dundee.ac.uk/14-3-3-Pred](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred/)
