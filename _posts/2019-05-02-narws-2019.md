Our latest service update article titled
[The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools APIs in 2019](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W636/5446251) 
has been published in *Nucleic Acids Research*, Web Server Issue.

In this paper, we describe the various enhancements made recently to EBI Saerch and Job Dispatcher services. 
Additionally, examples of integration between the resources are provided, 
which aim to demonstrate the ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) capabilities of the APIs.

For those not so familiar with Job Dispatcher and EBI Search, the abstract should give a good idea what these are about:

> The EMBL-EBI provides free access to popular bioinformatics sequence analysis applications 
> as well as to a full-featured text search engine with powerful cross-referencing and data
> retrieval capabilities. Access to these services is provided via user-friendly web interfaces 
> and via established RESTful and SOAP Web Services APIs 
> (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/EMBL-EBI+Web+Services+APIs+-+Data+Retrieval).
> Both systems have been developed with the same core principles that allow them to 
> integrate an ever-increasing volume of biological data, making them an integral 
> part of many popular data resources provided at the EMBL-EBI. Here, we describe
> the latest improvements made to the frameworks which enhance the interconnectivity 
> between public EMBL-EBI resources and ultimately enhance biological data 
> discoverability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability.
