After a few attempts at blogging over the last decade or so, it is the time to get back at it again! 

I was trying to remember when I started blogging, and I believe it was in around 2008. I started blogging 
on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) about things that were interesting to me at the time. Music and such things, but 
unfortunately those posts are forever lost. I can't find any of my login details nor can I even recall the blog's name!

Around 2011, I then move to write on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) about topics related to what I was 
studying and my first encounters with programming. I started on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) a few times, 
and then found 
about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The very same blogging platform 
I am still using to host this newer iteration of my homepage.

No big promises, but I hope this time around I can get things rolling. I am keeping older posts 
here for archival purposes. Feel free to have a look around!
