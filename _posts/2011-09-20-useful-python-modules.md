A tiny collection of useful python modules for Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining, as well as Web Frameworks:

Constraint Programming:

* [CPSP Tools](http://cpsp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de:8080/index.jsp) - Constraint-based Protein Structure Prediction. The CPSP-tools package provides programs to solve exactly and completely the problems typical of studies using 3D lattice protein models. Among the tasks addressed are the prediction of globally optimal and/or suboptimal structures as well as sequence design and neutral network exploration.

* [or-tools](http://code.google.com/p/or-tools/) - Operations Research Tools developed at Google. This project hosts operations research tools developed at google and made available open source. The project contains multiple tools: a Constraint Programming solver; a wrapper around third party linear solvers (glpk. CLP, CBC, SCIP); Knapsack algorithms; graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum assignment).

* [Gecode bindings for Python](https://launchpad.net/gecode-python ). This project provides Python bindings for the [Gecode](http://www.gecode.org/) constraint programming library. It is implemented using Cython. 

Artificial Intelligence:

* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/) - Machine Learning in Python. Powers machine learning python projects.

* [MDP](http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/) - Modular toolkit for Data Processing. Especially designed for data-mining projects.

* [patterns](http://usefulpatterns.org/msop/index.php?p=patterns) - Useful Pattern Set Mining. 
This project aims to serve as a general resource for researchers interested in pattern and pattern set mining.


Web Frameworks:

* [Django](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Django) - Web framework for perfectionists (with deadlines). Django is probably the most used web framework for python that promises rapid development and clean, pragmatic design of high-performing, elegant Web applications.

* [Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/). Pylons is a lightweight Web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid development. It was one of the first to leverage the WSGI standard, which allows extensive re-use and flexibility but only if you need it.
