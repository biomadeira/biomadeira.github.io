I seem to be doing good at poster sessions firstly because I got selected for oral poster presentation at the [ISMB/ECCB 2015](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015) conference in Dublin. That was in addition to a travel fellowship generously awarded by ECCB. As if that was not enough, now I got a poster prize by Dundee Cell Products at the SLS Poster session for 3rd year PhD students in the School of Life Sciences at University of Dundee.
