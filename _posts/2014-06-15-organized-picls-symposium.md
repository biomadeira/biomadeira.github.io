Together with a bunch of PhD students from the College of Life Sciences at University of Dundee I organized the [PiCLS symposium 2014](http://piclssymposium.org/2014/). My main task was to develop the website, which I did with [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).

The event was a great success and featured several high profile scientists covering many areas of research such as molecular biology and plant sciences. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed the event, even the speakers were please with way things went!

More interest to me was the fact that we manage to convince [Dr. Ewan Birney](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~birney/), which is the  Associate Director of the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), to come be our plenary speaker. 
It was a great pleasure to meet him, and as you can see I was really excited to hear him bash R hard.
