After a few attempts at blogging over the last decade or so, I have decided now it is the time to get back at it again! 

I was trying to remember when I started blogging and I believe it was around 2008. I started blogging on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) about things that were interesting to me. Music and such things, but unfortunately those posts are lost forever. I can't find my login details or the blog's name.

Around 2011, I then move to write on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) about topics related to what I was studying and my first encounters with programming. I tried wordpress a few times, and then found about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that leads me to this very same blogging platform I am using to host this newer iteration of my homepage.

No big promises, but I hope this time around I can get things rolling. I will be keeping older posts here archival purposes.
