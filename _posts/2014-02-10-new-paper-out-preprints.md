Just submitted a paper to an undisclosed journal and the good news is that it has been also made available through a new preprints server for biology, [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/) that is.
  
The paper is about a new approach of using coevolution data and constraint programming methods to improve protein-protein docking. If you want to know more check the paper [here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/02/03/002329), and any comments are much appreciated.
