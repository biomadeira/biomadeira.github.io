Hello folks!

After reading a very nice post [about Jekyll and GitHub Pages](http://www.ksornberger.com/blog/blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/) by Kevin Sornberger, I decided to build a new home using the same approach. Actually, since all the code is hosted on GitHub and everything is open source, I ended up using his code almost entirely. This way I can get the fun of it more quickly and I can design later.

What will be the scope of this Blog? In short, I am going to share some of the things that I will be doing in the next years, during my PhD. I can tell that it will be fun!

Stay tuned :)
