Time to celebrate again! 

I have got my second paper out! This time is a first author one and will be presented in Vilamoura, Portugal, next month at the [International Conference on Bioinformatics Models, Methods and Algorithms - BIOINFORMATICS 2012](http://www.bioinformatics.biostec.org/BIOINFORMATICS2012/).

Have a look at the paper [here](http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0003737901430149)! The code is also available in [Github](http://github.com/biomadeira/pycoevol).
