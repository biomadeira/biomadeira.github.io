Time to celebrate again! 

I have got my second paper out! This time is a first author one and will be presented in Vilamoura, Portugal, 
next month at the
[International Conference on Bioinformatics Models, Methods and Algorithms - BIOINFORMATICS 2012](http://www.bioinformatics.biostec.org/BIOINFORMATICS2012/).

The title of the paper is "PYCOEVOL: A Python workflow to study protein-protein coevolution" and you can read the 
abstract here:

> Protein coevolution has emerged as an important research topic. Several methods and scoring systems were 
> developed to quantify coevolution, though the quality of the results usually depends on the completeness 
> of the biological data. To simplify the computation of coevolution indicators from the data, we have 
> implemented a fully integrated and automated workflow which enables efficient analysis of protein coevolution, 
> using the Python scripting language. Pycoevol automates access to remote or local databases and third-party 
> applications, including also data processing functions. For a given protein complex under study, Pycoevol 
> retrieves and processes all the information needed to undergo the analysis, namely homologous sequence search, 
> multiple sequence alignment computation and coevolution analysis, using a Mutual Information indicator. In 
> addition, friendly output results are created, namely histograms and heatmaps of inter-protein mutual 
> information scores, as well as lists of si gnificant coevolving residue pairs. An illustrative example 
> is presented. Pycoevol is platform independent, and is available under the general public license 
> from http://github.com/biomadeira/pycoevol.
