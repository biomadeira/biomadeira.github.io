I recently move to Cambridge, to start my work at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/).
I had been to Cambridge before and EBI was on my top list places to work after my PhD, 
which I carried out in Dundee. Sometimes your wishes become true and here I am!

I will be missing Dundee, though! Dundee has been a great city to live in, and I have made many friends
and so many memories! I am sure I will come back!

last 5-years ðŸ˜¢ Will I ever come back?
