I have spent some nice time over the last months rotating in 3 labs as part of the first year of my PhD programme in Dundee. I rotated in the labs of Prof. Carol MacKintosh, Prof. Geoff Barton and Prof. Ron Hay. 

Now it is time to move back to [Geoff's](www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk), where I did my second rotation, as computational biology and programming is what I want to do. Now is also time to think what my PhD project will be about...
