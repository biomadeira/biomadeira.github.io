A highly comprehensive collection of protein interactions databases, predictors as well as web tools can be found [here](http://ppi.fli-leibniz.de/jcb_ppi_databases.html)!

Notably, [PIBASE](http://pibase.janelia.org/pibase2010/introduction.html) is a collection of all protein structural interfaces extracted from the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and [PISA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html) structure databases. Both chain-chain and domain-domain ([SCOP](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) and [CATH](http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/) definitions) interfaces are detected. A series of properties are then computed for each domain, interface, and complex.

You can also test several interface calculators, such as [ProtinDB](http://protindb.cs.iastate.edu/VisualizationIR.py) and [PIC](http://pic.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/index.html).
