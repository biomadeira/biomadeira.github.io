Great news! 

The work I have done as part of my first rotation with Prof. Carol MacKintosh and Dr. Michele Tinti, has been published in Database Journal. My part in this work was to help Michele improving on the prediction methods he had to predict 14-3-3-binding targets as well as to develop a webserver database to enable quick hypothesis testing. The server is called [ANIA: Annotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3 interactome](https://ania-1433.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/prediction/webserver/index.py) and was developed in Python using modpython.

The paper is open access and can be found at the reference below:
