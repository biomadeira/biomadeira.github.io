Our latest service update article titled [Search and sequence analysis tools services from EMBL-EBI in 2022](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac240/6567472) has been published in *Nucleic Acids Research*, Web Server Issue.

In this paper we update the community on the latest developments in both Job Dispatcher sequence analysis services as well as EBI Search. 
We describe recent improvements to these services and updates made to accommodate the increasing data requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For those not so familiar with Job Dispatcher and EBI Search, the abstract should give a good idea what these are about:

> The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools frameworks provide integrated access to EMBL-EBIâ€™s data resources and core bioinformatics analytical tools. 
> EBI Search (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch) provides a full-text search engine across nearly 5 billion entries, while the 
> Job Dispatcher tools framework (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services) enables the scientific community to perform a diverse range of sequence analysis
> using popular bioinformatics applications. Both allow users to interact through user-friendly web applications, as well as via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs. 

A good summary of all the bioinformatics applications available through JD in 2022 is provided below:
