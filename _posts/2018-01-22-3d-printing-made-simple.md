title: 3D printing protein models made simple

tldr; 3D printing protein structure models is made simple with the help of powerful Molecule Viewers and affordable 3D printing servicesâ€¦

3D printing is an emerging technology that has been in my mind for years as a way of printing physical three-dimensional models of proteins. These not only are very entertaining to play with, but also can aid in visualising the molecule and its components.

During my job interviews at the European Bioinformatics Institute, I could not have noticed the lovely collection of 3D printed proteins they had on display.
