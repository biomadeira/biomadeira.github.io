Big times for me! 

My first ever paper is out! It will be presented in Italy next month at the [Workshop on Constraint Based Methods for Bioinformatics - WCB'11](http://www.dmi.unipg.it/WCB11/), which is a workshop satellite to the [International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming - CP 2011](http://www.dmi.unipg.it/cp2011/).
  
Have a look at the paper [here](http://www.dmi.unipg.it/WCB11/wcb11proc.pdf)!
