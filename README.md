# My personal homepage

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and others. 
It is implemented as a port of Ghost's [Attila](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila/) theme, maintained by Peter Amende, with a few modifications.

## Developing locally

Install dependencies with bundle:
```bash
bundle install --path ./vendor/bundle
```

Then run locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

Github actions is used to build and publish the static website. Simply push changes or submit PR's to get your posts or changes published.

## Adding new authors

This blog supports multiple authors. Add a new author info to [\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml) and add the 
corresponding `username` to `author` in the front matter of every post.

## Adding new tags

This blog supports multiple tags. Each post can be tagged with multiple keywords. Add a new tag info to [\_data/tags.yml](_data/tags.yml) and add the 
corresponding `name` to `tags` in the front matter of every post.

## Generating Markdown tables

Thanks to [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) we can easily generate tables in Markdown.

## Compiling CSS styles

Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.
